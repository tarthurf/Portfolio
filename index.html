                    Hello, my name is Tyler Arthur and I am a web developer. This is my portfolio, a place where I keep my projects for anyone who is interested to look at. This website started out without much of anything in it, but as I learn and grow so will my projects as and their complexity. I don’t have a set idea of what I would like to do as a web developer but I feel like that gives me an advantage. I don’t have a preordained path that I want to follow and often times wandering can lead you to wondrous places you never thought you would end up. 
                    <br><br>
                    I have worked in many fields up until now including clothing retail, HVAC sales, delivery driver, beer distribution, computer manufacturing, and I even had a short stint of employment in an adult entertainment store (head over to the contact page if you want to hear some stories). On top of those, I served in the Army National Guard for 7 years and also run a small dog sitting business. 
                    <br><br>
                    Many avenues of my life have led me to web development, mainly my love of problem solving, tinkering with software, messing around with different Linux distros, and jail-breaking phones and tablets. I also am an avid player of tabletop role-playing games like Dungeons and Dragons and often run games and build the worlds my players reside in from scratch. I am also an active person but above all enjoy rock climbing indoors and out, whenever I get a chance.
